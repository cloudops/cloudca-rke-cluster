## Resources

It will create the required infrastructure:

- one or several k8s master node(s)
- two or several k8s worker nodes

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12+
- [Terraform Provider for cloud.ca](https://github.com/cloud-ca/terraform-provider-cloudca) 1.5+
- [Terraform Provider for RKE](https://github.com/yamamoto-febc/terraform-provider-rke) 0.14.1
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs) 0.5+

## Available Kubernetes Versions

Version of Kubernetes to be used in the RKE cluster can be controlled with [kubernetes_version](#kubernetes_version), which depends on the version of terraform-provider-rke being used in which depends on the version of RKE binary beind used in that provider version.

To get the list of available (and the default) version of Kubernetes take a look at release notes of [terraform-provider-rke](https://github.com/yamamoto-febc/terraform-provider-rke/releases) and [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases) respectively.
